<h2>Tips to apply for a PhD</h2>

<p>A PhD is a lengthy degree - it will likely take four years of your life. Unlike a taught degree, it is highly specialised in one or two areas of research. That’s a long time to spend on something that doesn’t genuinely excite you.

<p> The first question to ask yourself is: Why do you want to do a PhD?  People have many reasons, but in my view, the best one is a strong curiosity about a particular area or problem in computer science. Are you fascinated by some problems and wish someone would give you time to try out all your ideas? That's an excellent way to begin! </p>

<p>
Let me tell you how I see my role. I consider myself your advisor, not your supervisor - in other words, I am not your boss. I’ll do my best to support you, offer guidance, and suggest ideas when needed. But ultimately, you will make your own decisions. You are free to disagree with me, and I expect that to happen. In fact, if by the end of your PhD you haven’t told me I’m wrong at least once, you probably haven’t become the kind of expert a PhD should qualify you to be. </p>
<p>
I believe it’s essential that students have that level of independence. Personally, I wouldn’t have made it through my PhD if my advisor had tried to micromanage me. That said, I understand that some people prefer some people prefer to be told what to do step by step and treat a PhD more like a job or a taught degree than the creative, self-driven experience I want for you. That's okay; we can do that too, but if you already know that’s your preferred style, you might want to work with an academic who provides that type of supervision - there are lots who do the boss thing. </p>

<p>If you do want to do a PhD with me, here's how it will go: </p>

<p>After you first contact me, I'll give you a short 'do at home' programming test. This serves two purposes for me. The first is that it quickly filters out time wasters. "You're joking!" I hear you cry. No, really, there are lots of people who send out form letters to hundreds of academics. These people tend not to reply to a programming test. The second thing is that it gives me a quick idea of your programming ability. I assume you already know how to program, and unless you are amazing in some other ways, I would probably recommend you not do a PhD with me if you can't. This test doesn't have a deadline, but how long you take to complete it will be taken into account. </p>

<p>Next, we will have an online interview. I want to hear about why you want to do a PhD, what your ideas are, and find out if you're someone I could work with. I'll also give you a short 'live' programming test. "Another one, really?" Yes, some people have cheated on the at-home test before (and generative AI makes is harder to properly evaluate home-based tests these days)! Often, I invite another academic to the call to get a second opinion. You should use this call to find out at least how a PhD would work with me and whether you think you could work with me.
</p>

<p>You should probably talk to some of my students (or the students of any academic you intend to study with). Send them an email and maybe arrange a chat. Do they like working with me? What are my worst faults? Would they instead have done a PhD with someone else? And on and on. You never know what things they might tell you, and they could save you from making a horrible mistake!
</p>

<p>Now, you can apply using all the forms here. One important part here is that you write a research proposal. These are just a few sides of A4, structured like a research paper (abstract, background, related work, etc.). Even if I think you are great and want to accept you, students have to make it through selection panels where things like your CV and research proposal will be discussed and must be approved by several academics.
</p>

<p>While we wait for that, we (well, probably I) find you funding. You might need to fill out more forms to apply for various scholarships. Usually, the funding pays your fees and gives you a living allowance. This often also include travel money and a small equipment budget for a laptop or PC. The fees for overseas students are about twice that of UK students. There are also fewer pots of money that can be used for overseas students. These things mean overseas students are harder to fund and typically have to be that much better to make it worthwhile. Please don't let that discourage you. Funding is often found for great students! </p>

<p>Assuming we're all good up to this point, you should get an acceptance letter from the University. It could still be several months before your start date. You have to work out your travel and accommodation (sorry, the University doesn't give much help and gives no financial help beyond your stipend). Probably during this time, if you are up for it, we will meet online occasionally (say once a month) to discuss papers and ideas, etc. But, if you are busy working or doing whatever, don't feel you must have these meetings. </p>

<p>Great! Hopefully, you will accept the offer! This should be fantastic! I can't wait to meet you in person!</p>
