#### Zheng Wang ![Chinese Name](img/name.png)

I am a senior lecturer (~UK associate professor) in the [School of Computing and Communications](http://www.scc.lancs.ac.uk) at [Lancaster University] (http://www.lancaster.ac.uk) where I lead the [Distributed Systems Resarch Group] (http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/research/distributed-systems). 
I am a member of the [MetaLab Group] (http://metalab.lancs.ac.uk/) and the [HiPEAC Network of Excellence] (http://www.hipeac.net/). 

I build systems to allow computers to adapt to the ever-changing environment. My research spans code compilation, runtime scheduling, performance, energy efficiency, security and network communications.

I run [Compucast] (http://compucast.io/), a podcast for computer scientists.

July, 2018: I have two fully funded PhD studentships available. Being an advisor to students is the best part of my job. Have a look at my research interests and recent publications. If any of those grab you, send me with a CV and a short text describing your background.
