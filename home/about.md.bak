#### Zheng Wang ![Chinese Name](img/name.png)

I am an associate professor at the [School of Computing](https://engineering.leeds.ac.uk/info/20132/school_of_computing) at the [University of Leeds](http://www.leeds.ac.uk/).
I am a member of  the [Distributed Systems and Services Group] (https://engineering.leeds.ac.uk/info/201552/our_research/294/distributed_systems_and_services) at Leeds.
I am a member of the [HiPEAC Network of Excellence] (http://www.hipeac.net/). 


Previously, I was a senior lecturer (~UK associate professor) in the [School of Computing and Communications](http://www.scc.lancs.ac.uk) at [Lancaster University] (http://www.lancaster.ac.uk) where I led the [Distributed Systems Resarch Group] (http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/research/distributed-systems). 


I am interested in developing new methods and building systems to allow computers to adapt to the ever-changing environment. My research often uses machine learning as a design methodology. 
My work draws from, combines and contributes to the areas of compiler-based code optimisation, runtime scheduling, parallel programming and applied machine learning. My recent research also targets systems security. 

I am a receipient of the Best Paper Award in PACT 2010, CGO 2017, PACT 2017, CGO 2019, Best Presentation Award at PACT 2010, CGO 2013, a HiPEAC paper award in 2009, and Best Paper Nomination/Finalist in CCS 2018.

July, 2019: I have two fully funded PhD studentships available for Home/EU and International Students. Being an advisor to students is the best part of my job. Have a look at my research interests and recent publications. If any of those grab you, send me with a CV and a short text describing your background.  Please read [here] (phd.html) before apply.
